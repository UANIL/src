The SQL_Parser program offers multiple functions.
	s - search for a keyword
	  - parses all words in a file separated by a given delimiter
	  - prints all words that contain the keyword to screen

	l - 
	  - list all tables hardcoded into the program 
	  - these are all tables from the small (5.5GB) SQL data dump

	m - displays the menu of options

	r - runs complete file parsing
	  - this prompts the user for a given file
	  - also prompts the user for how often they want to be updated on the progress of the parsing
	  - parses the given file according to all the hardcoded table formats --
	  - these table formats are those existing in the small SQL data dump
	  - each of these tables are then outputted to individual files named <tablename>.csv
	  - each file only holds 1,000,000 lines, and additional entries go into numbered files
	  - ex: after <tablename>.csv fills up, <tablename>1.csv is created, then <tablename>2.csv, etc.
	  - if the file already exists, parsing will skip over that

	q - quit the program

NOTES FROM THE PARSED CSV FILES
	- each file represents a different table from the given file
	- not yet sure how the data between each table is connected
